Student User Story

Jessica is a part-time student working a full-time job. She is a diligent and dedicated student, but she is finding her physics class more challenging than she initially thought. Jessica's physics midterm exam is coming up, so she wants to review a few particular areas that she has struggled with so far this semester. She gets home from work at midnight and signs in to the tutor application to look at her previous tutoring sessions. Upon reviewing the video of her previous sessions, Jessica recognizes a gap in her understanding and needs clarification on a specific physics problem. She posts a message requesting an explanation of the physics problem and signs out. The next day, she receives an email with an explanation of the physics problem and a recommendation of some similar physics problems to work on. She continues to struggle with this particular area and so decides to schedule an additional live tutoring session. Since she has class in the morning and work in the evenings, she has to schedule her tutoring session at night, when she gets home from work. Luckily, there are tutors with availability overnight, so she is able to schedule her session.
