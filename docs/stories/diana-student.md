Tutor User Story Student View
A student is enrolled in a college course. They are either struggling and need further instruction or want supplemental learning. They log into their student portal through Canvas. They select their course and request a tutor via a button. They are then redirected to a page with a form asking relevant questions in order to assign a tutor. The questions can be, verifying the course subject, availability, and any specifics being requested on their subject. Once the information has been submitted, they will get a notification that a request was made, and an email will be sent to them once a tutor has been assigned. If they log in again later an update can be provided on the status of a tutor.
