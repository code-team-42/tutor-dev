Tutor:

Stanley is a teacher's assistant and he decides to sign up to tutor calculus on the weekends. When he is accepted into the program, he signs in and selects the scheduling tab and the scheduling page opens. He is presented with a table with the days of the week and under each day is a list of times in half hour increments. He clicks on each of the half hour increments between 10am and 2pm and between 4pm and 6pm under Saturday and Sunday, indicating that he is available from 10am to 2pm and from 4pm to 6pm on Saturdays and Sundays. Two weeks into the semester, Stanley receives an email notification that a student has requested tutoring at 1pm on Saturday. Stanley sign into the tutoring app and sees the notification. He clicks on it and presents Stanley with the information about the student and their request. There is a button at the bottom of the page that opens a form that allows Stanley to respond with a message directly to the student confirming the subject, time, and date.
